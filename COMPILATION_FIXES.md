# Compilation Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Screen Syntax Error
**Problem**: Extra "+" character at the beginning of the import statement
```dart
+import 'package:flutter/material.dart';  // ❌ Invalid syntax
```

**Solution**: Removed the extra "+" character
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';   // ✅ Fixed
```

### 2. Reports Screen Class Name Error
**Problem**: Invalid class name with number prefix
```dart
class 9ReportsScreen extends StatefulWidget {  // ❌ Invalid class name
```

**Solution**: Fixed class name to follow Dart naming conventions
```dart
class ReportsScreen extends StatefulWidget {   // ✅ Fixed
```
